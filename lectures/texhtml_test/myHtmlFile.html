<p>Many applications require robotic end-effectors and mechanisms to
move along periodic trajectories of given amplitude and frequency. If
motion parameters are known in advance, it might be beneficial to design
the mechanism in such a way that its natural frequency is close to that
of the desired trajectory so that controller needs to provide minimal
effort to generate sustained oscillations. In this paper, we investigate
natural nonlinear oscillatory behavior in twisted string actuators
(TSA), describing its mathematical model and providing experimental
verification of this phenomenon based on observations of dynamics and
energy. We also design an energy-preserving controller that is capable
of generating undamped oscillations of desired magnitude even under
severe constraints on actuator torque. Experimental study has
demonstrated that it was possible to induce undamped oscillatory
response of TSA with a 2-kg payload while applying a maximum of 6 mNm
motor torque, which can be used in robotic applications that require
periodic motions and high controller efficiency, like legged robots.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Various applications of mechanical engineering and robotics involve
periodic motion of the end-effectors, links and payloads. These include
legged robots, lower-limb exoskeletons, mechanisms providing cyclic
motion, and many others. One of the key aspects in control over such
systems is their energy efficiency. This calls for the use of
lightweight actuators with high power density and efficient control
schemes for them.</p>
<p>Twisted string actuators (TSAs) are rotary-to-translational
cable-driven actuators, in which torsional twisting of a bundle of
strings or cables results in their contraction. Key advantages of TSAs
include light weight, high efficiency and power density, and compliance.
These actuators are used in various applications including multi-legged
robots <span class="citation" data-cites="suzuki2005toward">(Suzuki and
Ichikawa 2005)</span>, lower-limb exoskeletons <span class="citation"
data-cites="kornbluh2018twisted">(Kornbluh et al. 2018, US Patent
9,950,422)</span> and mobile robots <span class="citation"
data-cites="sabelhaus2015system">(Sabelhaus et al. 2015)</span>, all of
which involve periodic motion of the payload. However, the dynamical
properties of TSAs have not been fully explored in these studies, with
the authors mainly employing the actuators for low-speed control.
However, these applications involved comparatively low payload forces
<span class="citation" data-cites="nedelchev2020accurate">(Nedelchev,
Gaponov, and Ryu 2020)</span>. When operating with significant payload
during high-frequency motion, a more efficient control approach might be
required.</p>
<p>Conventionally, TSAs are controlled in a uni-directional fashion when
the motor twists the strings from their initial state all the way until
desired contraction level is reached, and then back. Thus, if a fast
periodical motion of the payload is required, the motor needs to be
stopped and reversed 4 times during each period, around both zero and
fully twisted positions, which may cause power losses since the energy
generated by motor driver should be sufficient to overcome the kinetic
energy of spinning rotor inertia when stopping. However, one of the
unique features of the TSAs is their symmetrical behaviour: the strings
contract identically whether they are twisted clockwise or
counterclockwise. With this in mind, one can design a control system in
such a way that the motor twists the strings in both directions, which
will eliminate the need to reverse the motor in its zero configuration.
An additional benefit is that motor’s shaft itself, despite its
comparatively low inertia, can propel the payload by twisting the
strings on its own without drawing any power from the supply. As a
consequence, a TSA-driven system with proposed controller can reach
higher string contraction values with constraints on motor torque.</p>
<p>We have observed during the experiments that when the loaded twisted
strings were released freely from their contracted state, they twisted
in the opposite direction on their own after being completely untwisted,
carried on by the motor inertia. As the result, the strings contracted
again, sometimes working against significant forces that acted on the
payload, with no effort required from the actuator. This held true even
for comparatively small values of rotor inertia. Thus, knowing some
intrinsic properties of a TSA-powered setup such as its natural
frequency, one can leverage the tendency of TSA to oscillate freely in
order to design an efficient controller which will be able to induce
periodical motion of the payload with minimal motor power required. This
controller can maintain the mechanical energy of the system at a
desired, constant level by compensating for the power losses within the
system, effectively turning the setup into a frictionless nonlinear
pendulum. In this work, we have implemented an energy-preserving control
law on a practical linear TSA setup, and designed it so that it
supported undamped oscillatory response of a 2-kg payload with desired
magnitude and natural frequency while requiring a maximum of 6 mNm
torque from the actuator.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this paper marks the first occasion
when free oscillations in TSA systems were studied, modeled, and
experimentally investigated. In addition, this work presents novel
experimental results on the application of energy-preserving control to
TSA-based robotic systems. Such systems and controllers can be used in
the limbs of bipedal and quadruped robots to ensure energy-efficient
locomotion, even in the presence of severe actuator limitations.</p>
<h1 id="modeling">Mathematical Modeling of TSA</h1>
<p>Before proceeding to the analysis of natural oscillations in twisted
string actuators, we would like to start with a brief overview of the
mathematical modeling of TSA. For a deeper insight and peculiarities of
TSA modeling, the reader may refer to previously published works <span
class="citation" data-cites="nedelchev2020accurate">(Nedelchev, Gaponov,
and Ryu 2020)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="popov2012study">(Popov, Gaponov, and Ryu 2012)</span>, <span
class="citation" data-cites="palli2012modeling">(Palli et al.
2012)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="kinematics">Kinematics</h2>
<p>According to the conventional representation of a section of twisted
string shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:schematic_diagram"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:schematic_diagram">1</a>(a), a cable of length <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and radius <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, twisted at an angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, forms a helix and contracts by
the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> amount. For the resulting
right triangle with the sides <span class="math inline">\((L-X),\theta
r\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> one can derive
the geometric constraint of twisted string as: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:geom_const}
\theta^2 r^2 + (L-X)^2 - L^2 = 0\]</span></p>
<p>It is important to note here that equation above is a second order
polynomial, and there exist two solutions for motor angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that correspond to <em>the same
contraction level</em> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Differentiating the constraint above yields the relationships between
the payload (output) and motor (input) velocities: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:x_dot}
\dot{X} = \mathcal{J}(\theta, X)\dot{\theta}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span> denotes the Jacobian of twisted strings
and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\theta}\)</span> stands for angular
speed. Hereinafter, we will omit the arguments <span
class="math inline">\((\theta, X)\)</span> for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the twisted strings Jacobian may be
represented in various ways, depending on the availability of motor or
payload variables: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:jacobian}
    \mathcal{J} = \frac{\theta r^2}{L-X} = \frac{\theta r^2}{\sqrt{L^2 -
\theta^2 r^2}} = \frac{r \sqrt{L^2 - (L -X)^2}}{L-X}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="energy">Energy</h2>
<p>Total energy of TSA can be represented just like that of any
conventional mechanical system as a sum of kinetic, potential and
dissipated energy terms <span class="math inline">\(E = E_K + E_P +
E_D\)</span> as follows: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:total_energy}
    E = \frac{1}{2} I\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m \dot{X}^2 + mgX +
E_D\]</span> where the first term represents kinetic energy of the
spinning motor shaft with inertia <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, the next two terms correspond to
kinetic energy of the payload of mass <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> moving at speed <span
class="math inline">\(\dot{X}\)</span> and its potential energy due to
gravity (here we assume the payload always moves along the vertical
axis), with <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> denoting the
gravitational constant, while the term <span
class="math inline">\(E_D\)</span> represents all the energy losses due
to friction inside the motor, payload’s sliders and the strings
themselves, as well as reflecting all other internal and external
disruptive forces, otherwise unaccounted for explicitly.</p>

alt="Schematic diagrams for the analysis of TSA kinematics (a) and dynamics (b)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Schematic diagrams for the analysis of
TSA kinematics (a) and dynamics (b)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Depending on the variables of choice, one may represent the kinetic
and potential energy with the motor-side or payload-side variables using
the kinematical constraints <a href="#eq.mod:x_dot"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.mod:x_dot">[eq.mod:x_dot]</a> and <a
href="#eq.mod:jacobian" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.mod:jacobian">[eq.mod:jacobian]</a> as follows: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:K_Pi_energies}
\begin{matrix}
    E_K = \frac{1}{2} (I + m \mathcal{J}^2)\dot{\theta}^2 = \frac{1}{2}
(I\mathcal{J}^{-2} + m )\dot{X}^2 \\
    \\
    E_P = mgX = mg (L - \sqrt{L^2 - \theta^2r^2} )  \\
\end{matrix}\]</span> where terms preceding the squares of velocities
<span class="math inline">\(\dot{\theta}^2, \dot{X}^2\)</span> represent
the reflected inertia values on the motor and payload sides,
respectively.</p>
<h2 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h2>
<p>A schematic diagram of a twisted string actuator with a connected
payload is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:schematic_diagram"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:schematic_diagram">1</a>
(b). After driving the energy equations, one may use Lagrange-Euler
approach to derive the equations of motion (EoM) of twisted string
actuators as follows: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:dyn_model}
\left\{\begin{matrix}
u = I \ddot{\theta} + \mathcal{J}T  + b_\theta \dot{\theta} + \tau_{d}
\\[0.5em]
T = m \ddot{X} + mg  + b_X \dot{X} + F_{d}
\end{matrix}\right.\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> denotes motor torque, <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> stands for string’s tension, the terms
<span class="math inline">\(b_\theta,  b_X\)</span> represent viscous
friction coefficients in motor and payload, respectively, while the
terms <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{d}, F_{d}\)</span> represent the
collective effects of all other forces at play inside the TSA system
such as dry friction, string jamming and external disturbance applied to
the payload. For more information and details on derivation of these
forces and particularly ones responsible for losses due to intrinsic
string compliance one may refer to our previous work <span
class="citation" data-cites="nedelchev2020accurate">(Nedelchev, Gaponov,
and Ryu 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Assuming that the constraint <a href="#eq.mod:geom_const"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.mod:geom_const">[eq.mod:geom_const]</a> always holds,
one may rewrite the EoM above with respect to motor acceleration as
follows: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:dyn_motor}
u = D_\theta (\mathbf{q}) \ddot{\theta} +
h_\theta(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}})\]</span> where <span
class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}
D_\theta = I + m \mathcal{J}^2\\
h_\theta = \big(b_\theta +
\mathcal{J}(m\dot{\mathcal{J}}+b_X)\big)\dot{\theta} + \mathcal{J}(mg  +
F_{d}) + \tau_d
\end{matrix}\]</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}\)</span> is the chosen set of
generalized coordinates, which may be either one of the motor- and
payload-side variables (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, respectively) or both of them,
depending on the model used to calculate the Jacobian with <a
href="#eq.mod:jacobian" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.mod:jacobian">[eq.mod:jacobian]</a>.</p>
<p>Just like in the case when driving the energy equations, one may use
the TSA kinematic model to rewrite the dynamics in terms of the payload
acceleration: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq.mod:dyn_load}
u = D_X(\mathbf{q}) \ddot{X} + h_X(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}})\]</span>
with the dynamical terms <span class="math inline">\(D_X,h_X\)</span>
defined as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}
D_X = I\mathcal{J}^{-2} + m\\
h_X = \big(\mathcal{J}^{-1} b_\theta + \mathcal{J}^{-2}
\dot{\mathcal{J}}I + b_X  \big)\dot{X} + \mathcal{J}(mg  + F_{d}) +
\tau_d
\end{matrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Having driven all the necessary dynamical and energy equations, we
now move onto the analysis of energy exchange within a TSA system, and
in particular, of that in its behavior in the singular
configuration.</p>
<h2 id="the-singular-point">The Singular Point</h2>
<p>It should be noted that if one is willing to use the kinetic energy
model derived in terms of the payload variables, a problem with Jacobian
singularity may arise (when <span class="math inline">\(\theta =
0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{J} = 0\)</span> as
suggested by <a href="#eq.mod:jacobian" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.mod:jacobian">[eq.mod:jacobian]</a>), which is also
the case for the dynamical model <a href="#eq.mod:dyn_load"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.mod:dyn_load">[eq.mod:dyn_load]</a>. Thus, it may
naturally seem that this singular configuration (<span
class="math inline">\(\theta = 0\)</span>) should be avoided at all
costs in the applications involving TSA control, unless this is
practically impossible.</p>
<p>From the physical standpoint, the singular configuration corresponds
to the fully untwisted state of the strings, which makes is impossible
to generate the payload motion (contraction speed <span
class="math inline">\(\dot{X}\)</span> is zero regardless of motor
specifications). As an immediate consequence, this implies that all
mechanical energy of the system in the singularity point can be only
stored (and dissipated by) in the motor shaft, since all other sources
of energy are zero (no torsional energy accumulated since the strings
are untwisted, zero payload-side potential energy since <span
class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> and kinetic energy). In addition, any
external force applied to the payload will not affect the motor torque
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> since the Jacobian is zero. All
of these imply that, if there is some kinetic energy within the system
in its singular configuration stored due to the motor’s inertia, a part
of it will be dissipated while the remainder will be converted into
other types of energy, e.g. into the kinetic and potential energy of the
payload. Thus, the peaks of various energy components contributed by the
motor and the payload will be occurring at different time instances.</p>
<p>One can see simulated energy curves as a function of time in Fig. <a
href="#fig:energies_simulation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:energies_simulation">2</a>, which were generated
after the strings were twisted and then released with zero control
effort from the motor side. The string parameters were chosen to be
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> = 170 mm, <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> = 0.75 mm. We have introduced non-zero
energy dissipation on the motor side to make the simulation more
realistic, and one can note in the figure that the total energy levels
decrease with time.</p>

<p>It follows from the simulation results that, unless energy
dissipation is excessively large, one should be able to observe
periodical motion of the system in the phase plane of actuator
coordinates <span class="math inline">\(\{\theta,
\dot{\theta}\}\)</span> and payload coordinates <span
class="math inline">\(\{X,\dot{X}\}\)</span>. Moreover, the phase
trajectory in the motor space should theoretically lie in all four
quadrants of the phase plane, while the payload’s phase trajectory must
be fully contained on the right hand side of the phase plane (since
solution of <a href="#eq.mod:geom_const" data-reference-type="eqref"

<p>As the next step, we have decided to repeat the simulations whose

and <a href="#fig:phase_plots_simulation" data-reference-type="ref"

and the experimental evaluation is described in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="orbits">Energy, Phase Trajectories, and Periodic Orbits in
TSA</h1>
<h2 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h2>
<p>In order to investigate oscillations in twisted string actuators, we
have manufactured the testbed shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:ex_setup"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ex_setup">4</a>. It is
comprised of a EC motor (Maxon EC-4pole 22 120W, 18V) equipped with a
quadrature optical incremental encoder (1024 CPT), a linear encoder with
the resolution of 18 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>m (Avago
H9740-1 360 LPI) to measure the actual string contraction and a digital
controller (32 bit Arm Cortex-M7 216 MHz core-based) connected to the
motor driver (ESCON 70/10). We have installed a pair of 0.75-mm Dyneema
strings in the TSA with the length of 170 mm, just like the ones used in
simulation.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/linear_setup.png" id="fig:ex_setup"
alt="Photo of the experimental setup: 1) linear encoder, 2) static payload, 3) EC motor with angular incremental encoder, 4) twisted strings " />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Photo of the experimental setup: 1)
linear encoder, 2) static payload, 3) EC motor with angular incremental
encoder, 4) twisted strings </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The setup operates as follows. The motor twists the strings, causing
their contraction. The strings pull up the bottom mount which moves
along three vertical sliders (fixed between the base and the motor
mount) and has a optical strip attached to it. Rigidly fixed to the
moving mount are three more thin metal rods that support the top
platform with a payload. The motion of the optical strip is registered
by a stationary optical encoder located at the motor mount.</p>
<h2 id="energy-and-phase-trajectories">Energy and Phase
Trajectories</h2>
<p>After we confirmed the presence of oscillations in a practical setup
similar to those suggested by the simulations, our first aim was to try
recreate the oscillatory energy behavior presented in Fig. <a
href="#fig:energies_simulation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:energies_simulation">2</a>. The corresponding
experimental plot of major energy components in TSA is given in Fig. <a
href="#fig:energies_exp" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:energies_exp">5</a>. One can note the similarities
between the simulated and experimental energy curves, with the main
difference being a slightly lopsided shape of the actuator kinetic
energy <span class="math inline">\(E_K^\theta\)</span>. This is most
likely caused by some effects at play in a practical setup which are not
reflected by the simplified energy model, namely, dry friction and
unilateral string stiffness (jamming) described in our previous work
<span class="citation" data-cites="nedelchev2020accurate">(Nedelchev,
Gaponov, and Ryu 2020)</span>. However, the general nature of the
oscillations, as well as their frequency, was predicted by the simulated
results fairly well.</p>

<p>Corresponding phase plots in actuator and payload coordinates are
presented in Fig. <a href="#fig:phase_plots_exp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:phase_plots_exp">6</a>.
Here, the shape difference between simulated and experimental phase
trajectories are more apparent, which calls for a deeper analysis if one
desires to predict the curves with higher accuracy. However, in this
preliminary research we were mainly interested in whether we would be
able to predict the peak values of positions and velocities (and the
corresponding energy levels) with enough accuracy, and the simplified
energy model allows to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="friction-compensation">Friction Compensation</h2>
<p>Once one has a satisfactory model of free oscillatory response in a
twisted string actuator that is confirmed by experiments, one research
question that can be asked is how can we use this knowledge to design an
energy-efficient controller for TSAs. Since the main causes of power
dissipation in the system are the frictional forces, their cancellation
(or at least compensation for) would naturally prolong free oscillatory
response in the actuator. Thus, we have designed a feedforward control
system which would introduce the torque <span class="math inline">\(u =
\hat{b}\dot{\theta}\)</span>, with a positive term <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> representing our guess of viscous
friction coefficient.</p>
<p>A time plot of three curves, corresponding to damped oscillatory
response of TSA for 3 different values of <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> are shown in Fig. <a
href="#fig:friction_cancellation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:friction_cancellation">7</a>. One can note how
increased friction compensation leads to prolonged oscillations, as
expected. Thus, if one can fully compensate for friction (e.g. with
feedforward/feedback linearization) in a TSA system, it is possible to
induce undamped oscillatory response in it with the ‘natural’ frequency.
Just like in any undamped system, total energy will remain constant
during free oscillations, with kinetic energy of the actuator converted
into kinetic and potential energy of the payload, and vice versa. The
reverse is also true - if one preserves constant energy levels within a
TSA-based system by means of control, they can induce undamped
oscillations with minimal control effort, which can be leveraged, for
example, when designing a legged robot.</p>
<p>Energy preservation in TSA is studied in detail in the following
section.</p>

<h1 id="control">Energy Preserving Control over TSA</h1>
<p>As discussed above, one can induce periodic undamped oscillations
within TSAs by conserving mechanical energy of the system. This can be
achieved by a proper selection of control algorithm, and this approach
is commonly known in literature as energy preserving control (EPC). The
following provides a brief introduction into the EPC and discusses
design and implementation of this control strategy to twisted string
actuators.</p>
<p>The concept of energy-preserving control has been originally proposed
by Wiklund et al. who demonstrated an approach to solve the swing-up
problem of inverted pendulum with this control strategy <span
class="citation" data-cites="wiklund1993new">(Wiklund, Kristenson, and
Aström 1993)</span>. The EPC technique was later applied to other
underactuated systems (Furuta pendulum, acrobot, three-link gymnast
robot, cart-pole) in the works of Iwashiro and Spong, with the studies
outlining regulation methods to reach desired energy levels even in the
presence of actuator constraints <span class="citation"
data-cites="iwashiro1996energy spong1996energy">(Iwashiro, Furuta, and
Astrom 1996; Spong 1996)</span>. Fantoni et al. have later demonstrated
how, using the passivity properties of the internal energy of a pendubot
system, one can bring the state either arbitrarily close to the top
position or to some homoclinic orbit <span class="citation"
data-cites="fantoni2000energy">(Fantoni, Lozano, and Spong 2000)</span>.
In addition, the EPC was successfully applied in robot control tasks.
For instance, Asano et al. have used this technique to control a bipedal
walking robot and discovered that the application of energy constraints
has significantly simplified generation of movement patterns <span
class="citation" data-cites="asano2004novel">(Asano et al.
2004)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-energy-preserving-control">Fundamentals of
Energy-Preserving Control</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful features of the energy preserving control
method is that it becomes much simpler to design a regulator for a
particular dynamical system. One starts the EPC design process by
driving a single energy equation of the system <span
class="math inline">\(E(q)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is a scalar position. In order to reach
some desired position <span class="math inline">\(q_d\)</span>, one
therefore needs to reach constant desired energy level <span
class="math inline">\(E_d = E(q_d)\)</span>. Then, defining the energy
error with <span class="math display">\[\tilde{E} = E_d - E(q)\]</span>
and choosing control law as <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq.con:epc}
    u = k\tilde{E}\dot{q}\]</span> results in energy error converging to
zero, which will eventually drive system energy to desired level <span
class="math inline">\(E_d\)</span>. This may be shown by analyzing the
Lyapunov candidate <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:v_dot}
    V = \frac{1}{2}\tilde{E}^2\]</span> whose derivative can be found as
follows: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:v_dot}
    \dot{V} = \tilde{E}\dot{\tilde{E}} = \tilde{E} ( \dot{E}_d - \dot{q}
u) = -\tilde{E} \dot{q}^T u= -k\tilde{E}^2\dot{q}^2\]</span> which is
strictly negative along all system trajectories, provided that <span
class="math inline">\(\dot{q}\neq0\)</span>. For more details on
stability analysis of this control scheme the reader is kindly referred
to the works <span class="citation"
data-cites="iwashiro1996energy spong1996energy">(Iwashiro, Furuta, and
Astrom 1996; Spong 1996)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, let us move onto implementation of energy preserving control in
the linear TSA joint studied in the previous section.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-with-a-linear-tsa">Experiment with a Linear TSA</h2>
<p>We have conducted an experiment whose main goal was to induce TSAs
load oscillation with amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(X_d =
20\)</span> mm starting from a fully untwisted configuration. the mass
was setted to be <span class="math inline">\(\hat{m} = 2\)</span> kg
which corresponds to the energy level of <span class="math inline">\(E =
0.39\)</span> J. In addition, maximal motor torque was set to be 6
mNm.</p>
<p>In order to regulate to the desired energy level we have implemented
control law <a href="#eq.con:epc" data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.con:epc">[eq.con:epc]</a>, with actual energy
provided by equation <a href="#eq.mod:total_energy"
data-reference-type="eqref"
data-reference="eq.mod:total_energy">[eq.mod:total_energy]</a> except
for the dissipative term <span class="math inline">\(E_D\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq.con:total_energy}
    E = \frac{1}{2} \hat{I}\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\hat{m} \dot{X}^2
+ \hat{m}gX\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I},
\hat{m}\)</span> denote our estimates of the motor inertia and payload
mass, respectively. The value of motor inertia was identified to be
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}=9.7\)</span> gcm<span
class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. Load position <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> was measured directly while <span
class="math inline">\(\dot{\theta},\dot{X}\)</span> was estimated with
backward difference with data sampling frequency of 3 kHz. No other
computations or measurements were necessary for energy calculations.</p>
<p>Time plots of resulting payload motion and motor torque are presented
in Figure <a href="#fig:time_plots_X_torque_epc"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:time_plots_X_torque_epc">8</a>. One can note that it
takes the controller about 2.5 periods in as many seconds to reach
desired contraction levels, while the motor torque remains bounded.
Motor controller had a hardware cutoff at 6 mNm torque, which is shown
by a horizontal dashed line in Fig. <a
href="#fig:time_plots_X_torque_epc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:time_plots_X_torque_epc">8</a> (bottom), while the
intermittent peaks exceeding these values are the result of noise in
electrical current measurements that were used to compute motor torque.
For the sake of comparison, if one simply commands the motor to twist
the strings and drive the payload to the desired contraction level with
the same torque constraint of 6 mNm, the load gets after travelling
approximately 3 mm, as shown by the curve labeled ‘PD control’ in Fig.
<a href="#fig:time_plots_X_torque_epc" data-reference-type="ref"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Experimental time plots of payload
position (top) and motor torque (bottom) in a TSA with energy-preserving

</figure>
<p>Once the desired energy level has been reached, the controller
conserves it throughout the experiment, as shown in Fig. <a

plots in the actuator and payload space are shown in Fig. <a

data-reference="fig:phase_plot_EPC">10</a>. One can note with the help
of overlaid vector fields (computed with the proposed mathematical
model) that oscillations starting from the origin diverge toward the
final limit cycle, while those that start outside converge to it, which
suggests stable controller behavior. The same observation holds for both
motor and payload responses.</p>

<p>These experiments confirm that energy preserving control can indeed
be successfully implemented in twisted string actuators to generate
undamped oscillatory response with nearly-constant energy levels, as was
suggested by our initial hypothesis. Design of controllers of this type
is fairly simple and straightforward, and therefore these results seem
very encouraging.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this paper, we investigated free oscillatory response of linear
twisted string actuators. We have outlined a mathematical model based on
energy observations and TSA dynamics that could predict the oscillations
with satisfactory accuracy and described energy conversion within
TSA.</p>
<p>One important consequence of understanding the nature of oscillatory
responses in twisted string actuators is the ability to design TSA-based
robotic systems that could efficiently leverage the advantages of this
oscillatory process for the purposes of control. As one example, with
appropriate controller selection one can deliberately induce undamped
oscillatory response in TSA by preserving mechanical energy within a
system at a desired level. We have implemented one such technique
(energy-preserving control) and validated it in a series of hardware
experiments. The tests have demonstrated that it was possible to
generate undamped oscillatory response in a TSA with a payload of 2 kg
while exerting a maximum of 6 mNm torque. This suggests that energy
preserving control can be used in combination with TSA to ensure
power-efficient locomotion, and this control strategy can also be used
in applications that pose high requirements to power efficiency and
require periodic movements of a certain magnitude.</p>
<p>In the simplest TSA module like the one studied in this paper, we can
only control the magnitude of the oscillations and not their frequency.
However, if one introduces an element with variable stiffness, it should
become possible to control both frequency and magnitude, thus supporting
a more diverse range of periodic motions. This can be beneficial for
applications like legged robots that may require different gaits
depending on a situation, or for robots whose dynamical parameters can
vary significantly during periodic movements.</p>
<p>In the nearest future, we are planning to investigate oscillations
and extend energy preserving control to rotational TSA-based systems. In
addition, we are planning to design a 2-DOF robotic legged that employs
TSAs, induce oscillatory response and investigate the effects of contact
with environment (hybrid dynamics) on system behavior. When developing
TSA-based robotic limbs, one can design their movement trajectories in
such a way that they are as close to oscillations as possible. Once
designed, the controller will stabilize the resulting orbits.</p>
